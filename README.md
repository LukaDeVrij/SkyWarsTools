## What is SkyWarsTools?
SkyWarsTools is a stats website, similar to Plancke, Shmeado or Skycrypt. It specializes in tools for SkyWars. Similarly to the other tools, stats can be looked up for any player. But, every time someone does, these stats are also saved. This allows for stats progression through time.

Using these so-called 'snapshots' of stats, you can compare a snapshots with one from a long time ago, and generate session stats.

## Where do I use this tool?
The tool can be found at the following URL:
>lukatools.nl/hypixeltools

## How do I use this tool?
Please refer to the GitHub wiki pages for explanations of specific pages and features.

## I thought this type of usage was disallowed by the Hypixel API?
The Hypixel API policy states:
>Our API is designed to be used by players, and not for automated data collection at scale.
> -   For example, you may not use the API for continuous polling of player data for detection of stats earned in-game to offer a history to players using your website.

Keywords here include 'automated', and 'continuous polling', neither of which this tool allows for. The saving of snapshots can only happen once every 16 hours.
